## shelib callstack
shelib is designed to reduce loop declarations, unify argument parsing mechanisms and object-oriented style coding on shell scripts.

*cook* sets shelib callstack for the cooked function (hereby called **shelib function**) and *callstack* function is immediately invoked after the cook execution.

*callstack()* function invokes reserved parsers *parsecmds*, *parseopts* and *parseargs* and if you declare these reserved parser functions inside the shelib function, each of them is invoked in the order and the new callstack loop is set to run *shiftstack()* with shift value and arguments $@.

*shiftstack()* sets a new callstack for arguments $@ and make additional loop for given arguments with shift value. (so two arguments needed)
If no *shiftstack()* runs, all parser and *execute()* simply invoked, and exit.
All shelib function is style-free as like as generic shell functions and any constraints can be freely described in shelib functions in your order, with or without usage of shelib builtin functions.
